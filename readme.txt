Project Overview
This project addresses the strategic placement of police stations, 
sheriffs, and deputies in the Old West to protect settlers with limited resources. 
The territory is divided into NxM zones with varying family distributions,
 and the objective is to maximize protection within a given budget.

Objectives
-Place police stations and deputies to cover the maximum number of families.
-Use blind search algorithms to find valid solutions without heuristic evaluation.
